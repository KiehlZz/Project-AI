# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This project provides an analysis and prediction model for the **Titanic Disaster Survival** dataset. Using various machine learning techniques, the model predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## Project Overview

This project leverages the popular [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle, exploring feature engineering, data visualization, and machine learning model development. It aims to:
1. Explore relationships between different passenger features and survival rates.
2. Build a predictive model for survival using a variety of machine learning algorithms.
3. Evaluate model accuracy and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster** competition. You can find the dataset and related information [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Model Development

The following steps are taken to build the prediction model:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training with algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine
- Model evaluation using accuracy and other relevant metrics

## Code and Analysis
